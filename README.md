## shorebird-web

In-progress web app version of the Shorebird Sonification project.

To run this project, you'll need some audio files (not included in this repo). Add them to globals.js; the bird population will be based off of a list of indices to these audio files in initialSpeciesData. You'll need to run this on a localhost server for the Web Audio API to work.
